# CardioVascularRiskPrediction
Cardio Vascular Risk Prediction System
# Cardiovascular Risk Prediction System (CDSS)

A Clinical Decision Support System applying $L_1$-regularized Logistic Regression to assess cardiovascular disease risk using clinical examination parameters. Built with Scikit-Learn and deployed interactively using Streamlit.

## Key Performance Metrics

* **Test Accuracy:** 86.89% (~87%)
* **5-Fold Cross-Validation Accuracy:** 85.11% (± 2.50%)
* **ROC-AUC Score:** 0.9513
* **Clinical Screening Recall (Sensitivity at P >= 0.40):** 92.86% (Only 2 missed risk cases)

## System Architecture & Highlights

* **Leakage-Free Preprocessing:** Stratified 80/20 train-test split applied before fitting median/mode imputers and feature scaling.
* **Mixed-Type Transformation:** Continuous metrics and ordinal vessel counts (`ca`) normalized via `StandardScaler`; nominal diagnostics (`cp`, `restecg`, `slope`, `thal`) encoded via `OneHotEncoder`.
* **Embedded $L_1$ Lasso Feature Selection:** Automatically zeroes out non-informative clinical variables (such as fasting blood sugar) without fragmenting dummy-coded categories.
* **Clinical Sensitivity Tuning:** Interactive decision threshold control enabling physicians to prioritize recall over precision during initial cardiovascular screening.
